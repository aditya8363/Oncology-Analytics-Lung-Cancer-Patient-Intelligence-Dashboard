# Oncology-Analytics-Lung-Cancer-Patient-Intelligence-Dashboard
This project presents an advanced Power BI dashboard designed to analyze lung cancer patient data and uncover meaningful clinical, demographic, and lifestyle-related insights. The dashboard focuses on understanding disease progression, patient survival patterns, treatment pathways, and risk factors to support data-driven healthcare decision-making.

🎯 Project Objectives

The dashboard was built to address the following key objectives:

1) Stage-wise Patient Distribution
Analyze how lung cancer cases are distributed across different cancer stages.

2) Smoking Status vs Survival Outcomes
Evaluate the relationship between smoking habits and patient survival rates.

3) Cholesterol Variation by BMI
Examine how cholesterol levels vary across BMI ranges and their potential clinical implications.

4) Country-wise Patient Analysis
Identify geographic patterns and country-level distribution of lung cancer patients.

5) Distribution of Comorbidities by Cancer Stage
Understand how pre-existing conditions (hypertension, asthma, cirrhosis, etc.) vary with cancer progression.

6) Diagnosis Patterns Over Time
Track historical trends in lung cancer diagnoses and detect periods of increase or decline.

7) Clinical Treatment Pathway Analysis
Compare treatment types (Chemotherapy, Surgery, Radiation, Combined) and their associated outcomes.

8) Forecasting Future Diagnosis Trends
Apply time-series forecasting to anticipate future patient diagnosis trends.
